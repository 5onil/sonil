        introText: `Permit me to introduce myself
        <strong>—I am Sonil, your amiable local frontend developer,</strong> ever poised to
        transform your digital fantasies into breathtaking realities! I do boast a peculiar talent
        for <strong>Vue.js, JavaScript, and the enchanting sorcery of CSS,</strong> deftly
        interweaving them to fashion designs so mobile-friendly they entrance users. Ah,
        <strong>crafting experiences centered around the user</strong> is my forte, much akin to
        sculpting websites as sleek as a perfectly executed football maneuver. When I am not
        engrossed in the delicate dance of code, I find myself immersed in the latest technological
        innovations. <strong>My dedication to frontend development knows no bounds,</strong> not
        unlike the unyielding determination of the illustrious Jack Bauer. However, beyond the
        realms of coding, I am an aficionado of technology, deftly juggling between perusing
        podcasts and engaging in discussions about the cutting-edge trends of our era. Oh, and let
        us not overlook my ardor for muscles—both in the flexing of coding prowess and the
        occasional visit to the gymnasium! If perchance you seek an individual impassioned
        <strong>about the meticulous perfection of pixels,</strong> reveling in the chill embrace of
        cold beers, engaging in erudite tech discussions, or indulging in spirited banter about the
        sport of football, rejoice, for fate has led you to the right quarter! Let us, in harmonious
        unity, combine our skills and craft something truly magnificent together! Cheers!`,
